# Data Science Portofolio
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am a beginner in the field of data science, but I strive to show a professional impression in my projects.

I have completed several online courses and tutorials on data processing techniques and data analysis. In addition, I have practiced my learning in several small projects and demonstrated my ability to use various tools and technologies in data processing and analysis.

Here, you will find projects that I have worked on during my learning process. I strive to show a professional impression in every project I undertake, with a focus on good code quality, documentation, and layout.

Although I am still a beginner, I am very enthusiastic and eager to continue learning and improving my skills in data science. I hope that my GitHub portfolio can demonstrate my current abilities and show my progress in the future.

## Machine Learning Portofolio
* [Supervised Learning : How to Predict Customer Churn in a Telecommunications Company ](https://github.com/AqilaFadia/Aqila_Data-science-Portofolio/blob/main/predict%20customer%20churn%20Telco/how_to_predict_customer_churn.ipynb): Telecommunications companies face an increasing risk of customer churn due to increasingly fierce competition between providers. This can result in reduced company revenue. Therefore an effective strategy is needed to reduce the churn rate and retain customers.
* [Unsupervised Learning : Clustering Customer Airline Company ](https://github.com/AqilaFadia/Aqila_Data-science-Portofolio/blob/main/flight/FLIGHT.ipynb): Doing clustering on a dataset that contains customer data for an airline and several features that can describe customer value. developing a clustering model to group customers based on common characteristics, with the aim of providing valuable information for companies in optimizing their business strategies, such as marketing, customer retention, and developing better products and services. By helping companies make more precise and accurate decisions in managing their business.
