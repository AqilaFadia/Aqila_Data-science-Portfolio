# Data Science Portofolio
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am a beginner in the field of data science, but I strive to show a professional impression in my projects.

I have completed several online courses and tutorials on data processing techniques and data analysis. In addition, I have practiced my learning in several small projects and demonstrated my ability to use various tools and technologies in data processing and analysis.

Here, you will find projects that I have worked on during my learning process. I strive to show a professional impression in every project I undertake, with a focus on good code quality, documentation, and layout.

Although I am still a beginner, I am very enthusiastic and eager to continue learning and improving my skills in data science. I hope that my GitHub portfolio can demonstrate my current abilities and show my progress in the future.
