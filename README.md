# Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! 

I have completed several online courses and tutorials on data processing techniques and data analysis. In addition, I have practiced my learning in several small projects and demonstrated my ability to use various tools and technologies in data processing and analysis.

## Machine Learning Portfolio
* [Payment Default Prediction](https://github.com/FluffyArc/DefaultPayment/blob/main/Final_Project_Kelompok_8.ipynb): Develop predictive models that can be used to identify customers who are at risk of cancellation of payments and help companies take appropriate countermeasures.
* [Supervised Learning: How to Predict Customer Churn in a Telecommunications Company ](https://github.com/AqilaFadia/Aqila_Data-science-Portofolio/blob/main/predict%20customer%20churn%20Telco/how_to_predict_customer_churn.ipynb): Create a model to predict customer churn in Telecommunications Companies to deal with competition between providers which causes a reduction in company revenue.
* [Unsupervised Learning: Clustering Customer Airline Company ](https://github.com/AqilaFadia/Aqila_Data-science-Portofolio/blob/main/flight/FLIGHT.ipynb): Develop clustering models to group customers based on common characteristics, with the aim of providing valuable information for companies in optimizing their business strategies, such as marketing, customer retention, and developing better products and services. By helping companies make more informed and accurate decisions.
* [Reinforcement Learning: --- ](https://github.com/AqilaFadia/Aqila_Data-science-Portofolio/blob/main/flight/FLIGHT.ipynb):
## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* [Clothing Reviews Neural Network Model with TensorFlow](https://github.com/AqilaFadia/Aqila_Data-science-Portofolio/blob/main/Review%20clothings/Membuat_Model_NLP_dengan_TensorFlow.ipynb): Build a neural network model that was developed using the TensorFlow framework, to classify or predict clothing product reviews (clothing reviews).
## Computer Vision
* [Classification of Skin Cancer](https://github.com/AqilaFadia/Aqila_Data-science-Portofolio/blob/main/classification%20of%20skin%20cancer/classification_of_skin_cancer_.ipynb): Create a skin cancer classification model using Tensorflow. A skin cancer classification model using Tensorflow is being developed to recognize skin images showing signs of skin cancer. Building this model requires an expert team of data scientists, healthcare professionals, and developers to ensure its safety and correctness.
## Time Series
* [An Analysis of Stock Prices](https://github.com/AqilaFadia/Aqila_Data-science-Portofolio/blob/main/Time%20series%20saham/An_Analysis_of_Stock_Prices.ipynb): This analysis is conducted to see stock price trends, predict future stock prices, or to look for factors that influence stock price movements. In this analysis, time series analysis methods are used. The ultimate goal of this analysis is to provide useful insights for investors in making investment decisions.
